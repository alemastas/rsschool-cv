26 years old. He began his training history with receiving medical education, after which he got a job and I have been working in this field to this day. I lack depth of knowledge and career growth, which is why I get demotivated. As a result of the search for new sources of inspiration for self-development, he graduated from the SSTU named after. **Gagarin** in 2021, having received a diploma in graphic design. During his studies at the university, he acquired initial and basic skills in the use of HTML and CSS. I became interested in the IT sphere, inspired by the ways of my friends who found work in this area and get satisfaction from their work. As a result of all my thoughts, I began to study the issue. Began studying Python, interested in the specifics of working in IT. I set out to gain the necessary skills and find a job that has room to grow.
I own various software: graphic editors **Adobe Photoshop**, **Coral Draw**. 3D graphics editor - **Autodesk 3D Max**. I understand on Github. I also have artistic skills: creating character concept-art and environment concept-art. I am able to develop a design project for a specific topic.

##My Python code:

>```import random
>print ('Бинарный алгоритм поиска')
>print ('Я загадал число от 1 до 100. Сможешь отгадать? ')
>x = random.randint (1, 100)
>y = 0
>#print (x)
>while y != x:
>    y = input('Введите число от 1 до 100: ')
>    y = int(y)
>    if y > x:
>        print (str(y) + ' больше загаданного ')
>    elif y < x:
>        print (str(y) + ' меньше загаданного ')
>    else:
>        print ('Вы угадали число!')```

The main work experience is determined by the current profession in the medical field. In parallel, I worked as a freelancer and created artwork to order.
